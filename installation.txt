For the best experience with M28AI it is recommended you play on Forged Alliance Forever (FAF).  However, it should be compatible with LOUD, Steam and GOG versions of the game.  If you encounter issues with it, contact maudlin27 on discord.

Installation:
Forged Alliance Forever (FAF):
-Download M28AI either from Github (https://github.com/maudlin27/M28AI), moddb, or from the mod section of the FAF vault (accessible using the FAF client).
-If downloading via Github, copy the M28AI folder to the FAF mods folder (and rename from "M28AI-main" to "M28AI"), e.g.:
C:\ProgramData\FAForever\user\My Games\Gas Powered Games\Supreme Commander Forged Alliance\mods
-Go to the mod manager when hosting a game, and make sure the M28AI mod is enabled
-Select M28AI or M28Easy as a 'player' in the game lobby


LOUD:
-Download M28AI either from Github (https://github.com/maudlin27/M28AI), moddb, or from the mod section of the FAF vault (accessible using the FAF client).
-Open the downloaded folder/zip file, and copy/extract the "M28AI" folder to the LOUD usermods folder, e.g. (depending on where the forged alliance exe is installed):
C:\Program Files (x86)\Steam\steamapps\common\Supreme Commander Forged Alliance\LOUD\usermods

If you have downloaded from github, you'll need to rename the folder from "M28AI-main" to "M28AI".
I.e. the mod_info.lua file should be located at C:\Program Files (x86)\Steam\steamapps\common\Supreme Commander Forged Alliance\LOUD\usermods\M28AI\mod_info.lua

-Go to the mod manager when hosting a game, and make sure the M28AI mod is enabled
-Select M28AI or M28Easy as a 'player' in the game lobby
-Note: Additional game options should appear in the game options part of the lobby when re-loading the LOUD forged alliance exe after the first time M28AI was enabled (expected to be changed/improved in a future version of LOUD)


Steam:
-Download M28AI either from Github (https://github.com/maudlin27/M28AI), moddb, or from the mod section of the FAF vault (accessible using the FAF client).
-If you've downloaded from Github, rename the "M28AI-main" folder to "M28AI"
-Open up the mods archive using software such as 7Zip; the location of this will depend on where forged alliance is saved, e.g.:
C:\Program Files (x86)\Steam\steamapps\common\Supreme Commander Forged Alliance\gamedata\mods.scd\
-Open up the mods folder in this archive
-Add the M28AI folder to this archive/zipped file; if using 7Zip, this means doing click and drag on the M28AI folder into the 7Zip window showing the mods folder, e.g. into C:\Program Files (x86)\Steam\steamapps\common\Supreme Commander Forged Alliance\gamedata\mods.scd\mods\
-When creating a game in forged alliance, go to the mod manager and enable the M28AI mod
-Select AI: Easy for 'M28EasyAI', and AI: Normal for normal M28AI (and similarly the AIx versions of these to apply bonus resources or build rate modifiers to the AI)
-If the SorianAI mod is also included, then additional game options should show up to configure M28AI further

GOG:
M28AI should work on GOG similarly to steam (see above) - i.e. add the M28AI folder to the mods.scd archive.
